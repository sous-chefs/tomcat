## v2.0.0 (2016-03-02)

COMPATIBILIY WARNING!!!! This version removes the existing recipes, attributes, and instance provider in favor of the new tomcat_install and tomcat_service resources. Why not just leave them in place? Well unfortunately they were utterly broken for anything other than the most trivial usage. Rather than continue the user pain we've opted to remove them and point users to a more modern installation method. If you need the legacy installation methods simply pin to the 1.3.0 release.

- If a custom path is provided the trailing / will be stripped to prevent // in scripts

## v1.2.0 (2016-02-25)

- Added systemd and upstart support to tomcat_service custom resource
- tomcat_install no longer creates a logs dir in /var/logs/ as logging is up to the users
- custom paths no longer throw an error in tomcat_install
- path property in tomcat_install is now renamed install_path to match the tomcat_service resource
- the test cookbook now installs two different instances and includes the java setup the same way a wrapper cookbook would
- ubuntu 15.10 has been removed from the Test Kitchen config since there is no published box for this version yet
- debian 8 is now properly identified as a systemd based system
- inspec tests for the test cookbook updated to pass
- nil default properties have been removed to resolve Chef deprecation warnings

## v1.1.0 (2016-02-23)

This allows for running any Tomcat release on any distro (no more packages) and will eventually replace the existing attribute and provider config methods
- Added compat_resource as a cookbook dependency for the new custom resources
- Depend on java cookbook >= 1.36 to allow for OpenJDK 1.8 installs along with many bugfixes
- Test Kitchen now tests the new providers in Travis CI using kitchen-dokken (docker)

- UseConcMarkSweepGC is no longer hard coded in the Tomcat 6 config. Instead this is part of the JAVAOPTS attribute so it can be overwritten
